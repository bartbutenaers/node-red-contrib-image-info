# node-red-contrib-image-info
A Node Red node to get information about an image

## Install

```
npm install node-red-contrib-image-info
```
## Usage
This node can be used to get the following information about the image, arriving in the input `msg.payload`:
+ ***Format***: the format of the image in pixels.
+ ***Width***: the width of the image in pixels.
+ ***Height***: the height of the image in pixels.

```

In the above flow, the image is represented as a Buffer object.  However this node also allows the image to be base64 encoded, although this will have negative impact on performance (since a base64 decoding is required underneath):

This node is based on the [image-size](https://www.npmjs.com/package/image-size) library, where you can find a list of all allowed image formats.

## Output message
The information will be displayed in the node status, but the same information will be added to the input message:
+ ***Format***: the format will be stored in the output `msg.format`.
+ ***Width***: the width will be stored in the output `msg.width`.
+ ***Height***: the heigth will be stored in the output `msg.heigth`.
